My name is Kyle Jorgensen and I graduated with both my BS and MS in Computer Science in 2015. Currently I work on the Cloud Engineering team at [Workday](https://www.workday.com), where I help deliver a production-ready software platform for cloud computing.

While earning my Master's degree I studied with the UCSB [RACELab](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~ckrintz/racelab.html), where I was first exposed to various cloud computing technologies. For my Master's project I contributed to [SmartFarm](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~ckrintz/projects/index.html), which is an open source, hybrid cloud approach to agriculture analytics for enabling sustainable farming practices. This incredible experience greatly influenced my career path leading to my job at Workday.

Going to UCSB was absolutely the best decision of my life, because it opened the door to so many opportunities and experiences, such as study abroad. I was able to study in Lund, Sweden for a semester, and I took a variety of classes ranging from functional programming to Viking history. I am thankful for the many professional and personal relationships that I developed at UCSB, and to this day I still keep in touch with many alumni.
