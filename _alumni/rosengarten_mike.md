I studied Computer Science and graduated in 2012. While at UCSB, I was fortunate enough to have a varied set of experiences. There were many memorable adventures but my favorites include working at Invoca before it was a big company, winning Capstone with a silly but fun idea, and starting the ACM@UCSB student-run club.

During school, I started a college-only classifieds company called Mablio as well as a web hosting and advertising network called Synced. I then interned with CallWave for a little over a year and learned a lot about working on larger teams. After CallWave, I joined RingRevenue (now called [Invoca](https://www.invoca.com/)) when it was just the founders to help build out the early platform and product. I was fairly full-stack, working in Rails, doing whatever needed to be done (and that I could do). After Invoca, I took Capstone and built AnswerWise with a few friends. AnserWise was a mobile app that let you take a picture of anything, ask a question, and get an answer. That project, and winning Capstone, was probably the ultimate highlight of undergrad. We tried to make a company out of that idea but it just didn't work out, go figure :)

 After college, I joined Yahoo! as a software engineer and relocated to the Silicon Valley. I spent a few years at Yahoo! before founding [OpenGov](https://www.opengov.com/), a digital transparency platform for our Government. Serving as CTO was a highlight of my career so far; we grew the company to 75 employees before I left to work on another startup. I'm now CEO of Persista, a Government-focused technology startup in Palo Alto, CA. I still code.
