I joined [UCSB College of Engineering](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/) as a transfer student from [Los Angeles Pierce Community College](https://www.piercecollege.edu/) in 2014. I quickly integrated into the wonderful community with the help of our WiSH and ACM chapters.
I spent my first summer at an internship at [Workday](https://www.workday.com/) where I had a lot of fun, and learned that I could actually really contribute to real work in the real world! 
WhenI came back, having settled in and found my niche last year, I was free to expand. Given how much I owed WiSH and ACM for my experiance I took a leadership role in each.
I also got to work on really super cool research stuff in the amazing [RACElab](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~ckrintz/racelab.html)! Sadly, I graduated before getting to the best part of the research but now I was hooked.

Having discovered how much I enjoy research, I decided to continue, I am now at [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu/) researching how to make pacemakers better with [Behnaam Aazhang's awesome research group](http://aaz.rice.edu/students/) and the [Texas Heart Institute](http://www.texasheart.org/)!

I only spent two short years at UCSB but they where two amazing years packed with so much learning both inside and outside the classroom. The best thing about UCSB is the community. The students build each other up. We learn from each other and help each other. 
The professors really care and work hard to support us inside and outside the classroom. There are so many oppertunities to get involved and make more out of your time at UCSB everywhere you look and enough of a community to help guide you through all the options.
